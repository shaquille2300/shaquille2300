- 👋 Hi, my name is Shaquille (not O'Neal) - @shaquille2300. I'd been a consumer of github for quite sometime, but never supplier. 
- I'm looking to change that, as of soon/now, because I've been a software engineer/architect/evangelist for some 25+ years; working for 
- various companies, and currently going on 10+ years at Workday, Inc. as a Principal Software Engineer.
- 👀 On my "off time" from regular job, I very much try to stay up to date with tech/software advancements, dabbling on my own interested 
- projects.
- 🌱 Currently, I've developed curiosity in such frameworks as React, Vue, Angular, NoSQL, Hadoop, seting up a Raspberry Pi mini (and I mean Mini)
- data-center/farm; where I provision a VMware ESXi, Kubernetes, etc. Very exciting and excited about it - I shall report back on its progress...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Home/Office small-scale/small-factor rollouts, React/Vue/Angular, but open to anything. 
- While a Microsoft stack-tech savvy, I do not discriminate or shy away from the Java/Linus/Mac world. =)
